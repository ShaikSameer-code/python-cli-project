# CLI Based Student Management System (Python)

This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Student Management System 
developed using Python. The application manages student data entirely in memory.

## About the Project
The system allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on student records 
using a menu-driven CLI. Each student record contains an ID, name, and grade.
All data is stored temporarily in memory using Python data structures.

## Features
- View all students
- Add a new student
- Delete a student by ID
- Update student details by ID
- Menu-driven command-line interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Data Structures (Lists and Dictionaries)
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- CLI Input Handling

## What I Learned
- Implementing CRUD operations using Python
- Managing data using in-memory structures
- Writing clean and logical CLI programs
- Improving problem-solving and debugging skills
